            our pains in Lagos Central or representatives that will not put the

            With less than 8000MW power generation and a population of 200m,
            Nigeria simply does not generate or distribute enough power to meet
            its needs. Nigeria’s power sector needs far exceed the already
            stretched public finances. It is crucial for governments to make
            laws that attract greater levels of private investment to scale up
            generation capacity and help take electricity to those who need it
            most. And no other people in Nigeria needs it more than Lagos
            Central.

            In the 21st century where the world is driven by knowledge, the

            This is why United Nations recommend a sizeable amount of our annual
            budget towards ensuring that families have access to quality basic
            education for their kids. In Lagos Central, the situation is
            different where public schools are inadequate and private schools
            are very expensive. More than 80% of Lagos Central families send
            their kids to private schools (from kindergarten to University)
            because public schools are not great. These have to change. These
            and much more are my visions for Lagos Central on education:

            Agenda 7: Promote Innovations to Ease Traffic & Reduce Lagosians

            The perennial traffic congestions has become a normal phenomenon on
            our roads such that the people feel helpless and resign to fate.
            Traffic congestion is not fate. You see people wake up as early as
            5am in order to beat the traffic and they do this 5 days a week.
            These have led to increase in high blood pressures, stress and other
            health issues among the residents.

            We cannnot continue this way. We cannot continue with
            representatives who do not represent our aspirations. We cannot
            continue to representatives who cannot challenge incompetency. This
            have to change.
