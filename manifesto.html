          <p class="body-text">
            It is the job of the Senate to make legislation that secure, unite
            and make Nigeria productive. This is a long-term project that
            requires consistency. We can not achieve much of that with the
            people who do not care or with those who secured their candidature
            with a N100m application form.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            My mission goal is to change Nigeria and that will require changing
            those that represent us in the upper chambers of the National
            Assembly. We cannot do the same thing and get a different result. We
            cannot elect the same crop of politicians and change the country.

          <p class="body-text">
            The elders say “a tree does not make a forest”. As we seek to elect
            a new President in 2023, you will agree that an effective President
            needs a competent Senate. We need to constitute a Senate that will
            bring the people hope and instill confidence in investors who will
            facilitate our economic recovery.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            It is in our hands to determine the kind of society we want to live
            in, how we want to ensure common welfare and those who should
            represent us to achieve these common aspirations. One mistake we
            should not make is to elect people who are not deeply connected with
            our pains in Lagos Central or representatives that will not put the
            constituents first. We should not vote for those who make us feel
            more and more helpless about the change we desire.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            In this era of economic instability, hyper inflation, security
            challenges and incessant ASUU strike, if we want to change the
            narrative, then, <b> we must change the Senate!</b>

            Agenda 1: Stimulate Growth Through Youth Employment and Job Creation
          </h3>
          <p class="body-text">
            Nigeria’s youth unemployment rate is 42.5%. This implies that more
            than 4 out of every 10 Nigerian youths that can work and available
            to work can not find work. More so, Lagos also ranked the worst
            states with the rate of unemployment having about 2 million people
            without jobs according to a 2020 report by Statisence.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            My agenda if elected is to promote sustained and inclusive economic
            growth with full and productive employment for Lagosians through the
            following:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li class="body-text">
              Legislate development-oriented policies that support productive

              innovation,
            </li>
            <li class="body-text">
              Encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and
              medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial
              services
            </li>
            <li class="body-text">
              Develop and operationalize strategy for youth employment and
              organize mentoring programs that will help young people better
              prepare for their future jobs.
            </li>
            <li class="body-text">
              Ensure that Lagos State government improve resource efficiency in
              consumption, government contracts and production.
